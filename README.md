"I need a trading bot built on the Solana blockchain with the following features:

1. Wallet Tracker:

Ability to monitor specific wallet addresses in real-time.

Display balances of SPL tokens and SOL.

Provide notifications for any incoming or outgoing transactions.



2. Copy Trading Functionality:

Option to follow and replicate trades from specific wallet addresses in real-time.

Allow customizable trade parameters, such as trade size percentage or maximum trade limit.



3. Integration with Solflare Wallet:

Seamless integration for Solflare Wallet users to connect their wallet.

Secure handling of private keys and transaction signing via Solflare's API.



4. Integration with Jupiter Exchange:

Use Jupiter's API to find the best routes for token swaps on Solana.

Execute trades through Jupiter for optimal price and liquidity.



5. Additional Features:

Dashboard Interface: A user-friendly dashboard to view wallet activity, trade history, and performance analytics.

Risk Management: Include stop-loss, take-profit, and trade limits.

Custom Token Pairs: Option to specify which token pairs to trade or monitor.

Multi-Wallet Support: Allow users to connect and manage multiple wallets.

Automated Strategies: Include basic trading strategies (e.g., dollar-cost averaging, arbitrage opportunities).

Performance Metrics: Real-time performance tracking of executed trades, including PnL and ROI.

Notifications and Alerts: Send notifications for executed trades, wallet updates, or strategy triggers (via email, Telegram, or Discord).



6. Scalability and Security:

Ensure scalability to handle multiple wallets and trades concurrently.

Implement robust security practices, including encryption for user data and API interactions.



7. Development Requirements:

Use Solana's SDK or Anchor framework for smart contract interaction.

Ensure efficient and optimized code to minimize transaction fees and latency.

Provide detailed documentation for the bot, including installation, usage, and customization guides.




The bot should be modular and easily expandable to include more exchanges or features in the future. It must prioritize user data security, operate efficiently on the Solana network, and provide an intuitive experience for users."

## Project Plan
```
Hereâ€™s a **simple and clear project plan** for the Solana-based trading bot, broken into main tasks and technical considerations:

---

## **Project Plan**

### **Phase 1: Planning and Setup**
1. **Define Scope and Milestones**
   - Finalize feature prioritization (Core Features first, Additional Features later).
   - Break down tasks into sprints (e.g., 2-week sprints).

2. **Technical Stack Setup**
   - Set up Solana SDK/Anchor framework for smart contract interaction.
   - Integrate Solflare Wallet API and Jupiter Exchange API.
   - Choose frontend framework (e.g., React.js or Next.js) for the dashboard.

3. **Environment Setup**
   - Set up development, testing, and production environments.
   - Configure CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

---

### **Phase 2: Core Features Development**
1. **Wallet Tracker**
   - Develop real-time wallet monitoring using Solana's WebSocket API.
   - Implement balance tracking for SPL tokens and SOL.
   - Add notifications for incoming/outgoing transactions.

2. **Copy Trading**
   - Build functionality to replicate trades from specific wallets.
   - Add customizable trade parameters (e.g., trade size percentage, max trade limit).

3. **Solflare Wallet Integration**
   - Implement secure wallet connection via Solflare API.
   - Ensure private keys and transaction signing are handled securely.

4. **Jupiter Exchange Integration**
   - Integrate Jupiter API for token swap routes and trade execution.
   - Optimize for best prices and liquidity.

---

### **Phase 3: Additional Features Development**
1. **Dashboard Interface**
   - Design and implement a user-friendly dashboard.
   - Display wallet activity, trade history, and performance analytics.

2. **Risk Management**
   - Add stop-loss, take-profit, and trade limit functionality.

3. **Custom Token Pairs**
   - Allow users to specify and monitor custom token pairs.

4. **Multi-Wallet Support**
   - Enable users to connect and manage multiple wallets.

5. **Automated Strategies**
   - Implement basic strategies like dollar-cost averaging and arbitrage.

6. **Performance Metrics**
   - Track and display real-time performance metrics (PnL, ROI).

7. **Notifications and Alerts**
   - Add email, Telegram, and Discord notifications for trades and updates.

---

### **Phase 4: Scalability and Security**
1. **Scalability**
   - Optimize the bot to handle multiple wallets and trades concurrently.
   - Use Solana's high-throughput capabilities to minimize latency.

2. **Security**
   - Implement robust encryption for user data and API interactions.
   - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

---

### **Phase 5: Testing and Documentation**
1. **Testing**
   - Perform unit, integration, and end-to-end testing for all features.
   - Test on Solana devnet and testnet before deploying to mainnet.

2. **Documentation**
   - Write detailed guides for installation, usage, and customization.
   - Provide API documentation for developers.

---

### **Phase 6: Deployment and Maintenance**
1. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the bot to Solana mainnet.
   - Monitor performance and resolve any post-deployment issues.

2. **Maintenance**
   - Provide ongoing support and updates.
   - Add new features based on user feedback.

---

## **Technical Considerations**
1. **Efficiency**
   - Optimize code to minimize transaction fees and latency on Solana.
   - Use batch transactions where possible.

2. **User Experience**
   - Prioritize a clean, intuitive interface for the dashboard.
   - Ensure fast load times and responsive design.

3. **Security**
   - Use secure libraries for encryption and API interactions.
   - Avoid storing private keys on the server; rely on wallet APIs.

4. **Modularity**
   - Design the bot to be easily expandable for future integrations or features.
   - Use a microservices architecture if scalability becomes a concern.

---

## **Timeline (Example)**
- **Phase 1:** 1-2 weeks
